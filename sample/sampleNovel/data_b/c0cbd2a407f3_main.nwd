### Another Scene

@pov: John
@location: Space

This is the second scene in out story. We have no idea what’s going on, so we’re just going to ramble on until we have a few lines of text so that the editor has something to work with.

In fact, this scene is supposed to be about John, but we don’t really know anything about John, except that he is somewhere in space. Perhaps he’s lost? Or has gone where no man has gone before? Where is Jane then?
