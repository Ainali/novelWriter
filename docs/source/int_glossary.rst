   Root Folder
      A "Root Folder" is a top level folder of the project tree in novelWriter. Each type of root
      folder has a specific icon to identify it. For an overview of available root folder types,
      see :ref:`a_proj_roots`.

   Novel Documents
      These are documents that are created under a "Novel" :term:`root folder`. They behave
      differently than :term:`Project Notes`, and have some more restrictions. For instance, they
      can not exist in folders intended only for project notes. See the :ref:`a_struct` chapter for
      more details.

   Project Notes
      Project Notes are unrestricted documents that can be placed anywhere in your project. You
      should not use these documents for story elements, only for notes. Project notes are the
      source files used by the Tags and References system. See the :ref:`a_references` chapter for
      more details on how to use them.

   Headings
      Each level of headings in :term:`Novel Documents` have a specific meaning in terms of the
      structure of the story. That is, they determine what novelWriter considers a partition, a
      chapter, a scene or a text section. For :term:`Project Notes`, the header levels don't
      matter. For more details on headings in novel documents, see :ref:`a_struct_heads`.
