Installing Dependencies
=======================

If you already have Python installed, all you need to do is install the dependencies.
To do this, your need to open your command line tool, find the folder where you extracted novelWriter, and run:

.. code-block:: console

   python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

On some operating systems you need to use ``python3`` instead of ``python``.

The following Python packages are required to run novelWriter:

* ``pyqt5`` for the GUI
* ``lxml`` for writing project files

.. note::
   Sometimes the SVG graphics package for pyqt5 must be installed separately.

The following are optional, but recommended:

* ``pyenchant`` for spell checking
* ``pycountry`` for translating language codes to language names
* ``latexcodec`` for escaping unicode characters in LaTeX export
* ``pypandoc`` for additional exports to Word, Open Office, eBooks, etc.


Running novelWriter
===================

If all the required dependencies are met, you can run novelWriter from the command line:

.. code-block:: console

   python novelWriter.py

A few switches are supported from the command line, mostly to assist in debugging if an error is encountered.
To list all options, run:

.. code-block:: console

   python novelWriter.py --help


Building a Standalone Executable
================================

A standalone executable can be built with pyinstaller, using the provided python script "install.py" in the source folder.
This script will automatically try to install all dependencies and build the standalone executable of novelWriter.
You can run the script by typing the following into your command prompt:

.. code-block:: console

   python install.py

If successful, the executable will be in the "dist" folder.


Additional Instructions for Windows
-----------------------------------

If you don't have Python installed, you can download it from the python.org website.
The installers for Windows are available at https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/

novelWriter should work with Python 3.5 or higher, and the executable installer is the easiest to install.
Please note that the `pyenchant` package for spell checking does not currently work with the x86-64 version, so if you want spell checking, you must install the x86 version.

Also, make sure you select the "Add Python to PATH" option.

Once Python is set up and running, you can either run novelWriter from the folder where you extracted it, or you can build an executable and run that from a desktop icon instead.
