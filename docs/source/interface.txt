User Interface
##############

The user interface is kept as simple as possible to avoid distractions.
The main window contains a tree vew pane with the entire structure of the project, and a small details panel below it to display additional information.

Editing a document can be done by either double-clicking on it, or hitting the return key when the item is selected.
This will open the source editor which uses a simplified markdown format described in the section below.

The document can also be viewed as html with all the comments and commands stripped out. To view a document, simply press Ctrl+R or select a file and go to :menuselection:`Document --> View Document` in the menu.
The document viewed does not need to be the same document currently being edited.

Markdown Format
***************

the document editor uses a simplified markdown format.
That is, it supports basic formatting like bold, italics and underline, as well as four levels of headings.
The formats are listed below.

In addition to these standard markdown features, the editor also allows for comments, that is text that is ignored by the word counter and not exported or seen in the document viewer.
The editor also has a minimal set of commands used for setting tags and references between files.

* ``# Title``: Heading level one. The space after the # is mandatory.
* ``## Title``: Heading level two. The space after the # is mandatory.
* ``### Title``: Heading level three. The space after the # is mandatory.
* ``#### Title``: Heading level four. The space after the # is mandatory.
* ``**text**``: The text is renderred as bold text.
* ``_text_``:The text is renderred as italics text.
* ``__text__``: The text is renderred as underlined text.
* ``% text...``: A comment. The text is not exported, seen in viewer, or counted towards word counts.
* ``@keyword: value``: A keyword argument followed by a value, or a comma separated list of values.
