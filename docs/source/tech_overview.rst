Technical Overview
******************


novelWriter is built as a cross-platform application using `Python 3 <https://www.python.org/>`_ as
the programming language, and `Qt 5 <https://www.qt.io/>`_ framework for the user interface.

novelWriter is built for Linux first, so this is where it works best. However, it also runs fine
on Windows and MacOS due to the cross-platform framework it's built on. The author of the
application doesn't own a Mac, so on-going Mac support is dependent on user feedback and user
contributions.

Spell checking in novelWriter is provided by a third party library called
`Enchant <https://abiword.github.io/enchant/>`_. Please see the section on :ref:`a_custom_dict` for
how to install spell checking languages.

For install instructions for novelWriter, see :ref:`a_started`.
