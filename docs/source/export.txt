Exporting Projects
##################

The novelWriter project can be exported in various formats using the export tool available from :menuselection:`Project --> Export Project` or by pressing :kbd:`F5`.

**************
File Selection
**************

Which files are selected for export can be controlled from the "Selection" section.
The check box for "Novel files" will select any file that isn't classified as a note.
This is useful when exporting a document containing the novel itself.

It is also possible to select the "Note files" for export, with or without the "Novel files".
Comments can also optionally be included in the export for those formats that supports this.

**************
Export Formats
**************

Currently, five formats are supported for exporting.

novelWriter Markdown
====================

This is simply a concatenation of the files selected by the filters.
The files in the project are stacked together in the order they appear in the tree view, with comments, tags, etc. included.
This is a useful format for exporting the project for later import back into novelWriter.

Plain Text
==========

The plain text export format writes a simple ``.txt`` file without any formatting at all.
Word-wrapping to a fixed column width is supported.
It does, however, respect the centering of text if the :guilabel:`Fixed width` setting is larger than ``0``.

Markdown
========

The markdown export formats writes a file using the valid markdown formats used by novelWriter, and converts comments to preformatted blocks by indenting it with four spaces.
Word-wrapping to a fixed column width is supported.

HTML5 Document
==============

The html5 export format writes a single ``.htm`` file with a minimal style settings block.
The style setting block sets a maximum page width of ``768px``.
Comments are exported as indented text boxes with a light yellow background.

LaTeX Document
==============

The latex export formats generats a simple ``.tex`` file using a ``report`` document format.
All chapters and sections are exported as unnumbered, and the internal header numbering formatting of novelWriter is used instead.
Word-wrapping to a fixed column width in the LaTeX source is supported.

*****************
Header Formatting
*****************

The chapter, scene and section headers for novel files can receive some special treatment using the formats under :guilabel:`Chapter Headings` and :guilabel:`Other Headings`.
The chapters can either be of numbered or unnumbered type, the latter being suitable for prologues, epilogues, interludes, etc.
The headers can be generated using free text in combination with replace tags.
The tooltip will explain which tags are available for each heading type.

.. note::
   Header formatting only applies to novel files.
   Headings in note files will will be left as-is, but heading levels 1 through 4 are converted to the correct heading level in the respective output formats.

Numbered Chapters
=================

Numbered chapters can be automatically assigned a number from 1 and upwards.
The number is inserted in place of the ``%num%`` tag.
Alternatively, the number can be translated to a word by using the ``%numword%`` tag.
The word numbers feature is currently only supported in English, and works for the range from "One" to "Nine Hundred and Ninety-Nine".

Unnumbered Chapters
===================

Unnumbered chapters only support the ``%title%`` tag for auto-replacement.

Scenes and Sections
===================

Both scenes and sections support the ``%title%`` tag.
In addition, scenes behave differently than the other headings when the format does not contain any auto-replace tags.
If the text in the box is any static text, the heading formatter will treat it as a scene separator, and insert that text as centred text between scenes, and ignoring the first scene of a chapter if the chapter heading is not followed by any text.

Leaving these fields blank will disable any output of scene and section headers or separators to the exported file.
