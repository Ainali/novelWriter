Introduction
============

novelWriter is a simple multi-document plain text editor using a modified
markdown syntax to apply simple formatting. Additional features are available
through special meta data commands. These make it possible to generate an
overview of the entire novel project and how the various files are
interconnected.

The user interface is intended to be as minimalistic as practically possible,
and most features are accessible through the menu and through keyboard
shortcuts. The colour scheme of the user interface can be modified with various
themes, and new themes are fairly straight forward to add. They are separated
into gui and syntax themes, and can be found in the themes folder in the source
code.

The tree view has various sections for the various types of supporting files
that the User may want to add to the project. The novel itself lives under its
own root folder, and export features are in the process of being added. These
will include HTML, open document and PDF via LaTeX.
