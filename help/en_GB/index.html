    <h2>1. Novel Projects</h2>
    <p><a href="#Content">Back to top</a></p>

    <p>A novelWriter project requires a dedicated folder for storing its files. See the
        <a href="#Code">Technical Information</a> section for further details.</p>
    <p>A new project can be created from the Project menu by selecting <mark>Project > New
        Project</mark>. A list of recently opened projects is also maintained and can be selected
        from the menu.</p>
    <p>The project specific settings are available in <mark>Project > Project Settings</mark>. See
        further details below.</p>

    <a name="Proj_Structure"></a>
    <h3>1.1 Project Structure</h3>
    <p><a href="#Content">Back to top</a></p>

    <p>Projects are structured into a set of root folders in the left side tree view panel.</p>
    <p>The core novel files go into a root folder of type <mark>NOVEL</mark>. Other supporting files
        go into root folders of types <mark>PLOT</mark>, <mark>CHARACTER</mark>, <mark>WORLD</mark>,
        <mark>TIMELINE</mark>, <mark>OBJECT</mark> or <mark>CUSTOM</mark>. These other root folder
        types are intended for your notes on the various elements of your story. Using these are of
        course entirely optional.</p>
    <p>Deleted files will be moved into a special <mark>TRASH</mark> root folder. Currently, these
        files cannot be permanently deleted from the project.</p>

    <h4>Orphaned Documents</h4>
    <p>In the event the editor crashes or otherwise exits without saving the project state, files
        that have been added to the project tree and are saved to disk will appear in a special
        "Orphaned Items" root folder next time the application is started. These orphaned files will
        not have any meta data associated with them, so the title and other information has to be
        set again, and the files moved back to the correct location in the project.</p>

    <h4>Using Project Folders</h4>
    <p>Folders, aside from root folders, have no structural significance to the project. They are
        there purely as a way for the user to organise the files in meaningful sections and to be
        able to close them in the tree view. When processing the files in the novel, the folders are
        ignored.</p>

    <a name="Proj_Settings"></a>
    <h3>1.2 Project Settings</h3>
    <p><a href="#Content">Back to top</a></p>

    <p>The project settings can be accessed from the <mark>Project > Project Settings</mark> menu
        entry. This will open a dialog box.</p>

    <h4>Settings Tab</h4>
    <p>The Settings tab holds the project title and author settings. <em>Working Title</em> can be
        set to a different title than the <em>Book Title</em>. The difference between them is simply
        that the Working Title is used for the GUI (main window title) and when the export features
        are added can optionally be printed to the cover sheet. The Book Title, on the other hand,
        will only be printed to the title page on export.</p>
    <p>The <em>Book Authors</em> text box takes one author per line. The line breaks matter in that
        this is converted to a list for later correct formatting.</p>

    <h4>Status Tab</h4>
    <p>Each file of type <mark>NOVEL</mark> can be given a status level, signified by a coloured
        icon. These are purely there for the user's convenience, and you are not required to use
        them for any other feature to work. The intention is to use this list to set what stage of
        writing you are on, although you can in principle make them whatever you want.</p>
    <p>Note that status levels currently in use by a file cannot be deleted.</p>

    <h4>Importance Tab</h4>
    <p>Each file of types <mark>PLOT</mark>, <mark>CHARACTER</mark>, <mark>WORLD</mark>, 
        <mark>TIMELINE</mark>, <mark>OBJECT</mark> or <mark>CUSTOM</mark> can be given an importance
        level, signified by a coloured icon like for status level. These are also purely there for
        the user's convenience, and you are not required to use them for any other feature to work.
        The intention is to use this list to set how important the character, plot element, or
        otherwise, is for the story. Again, these can in principle be used for whatever you want.
    <p>Note that importance levels currently in use by a file cannot be deleted.</p>

    <h4>Auto-Replace Tab</h4>
    <p>A set of automatically replaced keywords can be added in this tab. The keywords in the left
        column wile be replaced by the text in the right column when documents are opened in the
        viewer. This will also be applied to exports when the feature is added.</p>
    <p>Note that a keyword cannot contain any spaces. The angle brackets are dded by default, and
        when used in the text are a part of the keyword to be replaced. This is to ensure that parts
        of the text isn't unintentionally replaced by the content of the list.</p>

    <a name="Proj_Documents"></a>
    <h2>1.3 Writing Files</h2>
    <p><a href="#Content">Back to top</a></p>

    <p>New document files can be created from the Document menu, or by pressing <mark>Ctrl+N</mark>
        while in the tree view pane. This will create a new, empty file, and open the item settings
        dialog where the filename and various other settings can be set. This dialog can also be
        opened again later from either the menu, <mark>Project > Edit item</mark>, or by pressing
        <mark>Ctrl+E</mark> or <mark>F2</mark> with the item selected.</p>
    <p>The different classes of documents have some restrictions.</p>

    <h3>2.2 Novel File Layout</h3>
    <p><a href="#Content">Back to top</a></p>

    <p>Files that exist under the <mark>NOVEL</mark> type root folder can have a number of layouts
        set. See overview below. These layouts are currently not used for any internal feature, but
        when the export feature is added they will be important in determining how the different
        sections of the novel is formatted.</p>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <td><mark>Title Page</mark></td>
            <td>The title page layout. The title should be formatted as a heading of level 1, that
                is one hash: <mark># Book Title</mark></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><mark>Book</mark></td>
            <td>In principle, the entire novel can be contained in a single file. In that case, use
                the Book layout on this file. The internal structure is then controlled by the
                heading levels.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><mark>Plain Page</mark></td>
            <td>A plain page is just that, It is not included into content and the heading levels
                are ignored.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><mark>Partition</mark></td>
            <td>A partition can be used to split a the novel into parts. Use a level one heading for
                this.</td>

    <h2>4. Technical Information</h2>
    <p><a href="#Content">Back to top</a></p>

    <p>This section contains details of how novelWriter stores and handles the project data.</p>

    <a name="Code_Project"></a>
    <h3>4.1 How Data is Stored</h3>
    <p><a href="#Content">Back to top</a></p>

    <h4>Main Project File</h4>
    <p>The project itself requires a dedicated folder for storing its files. The main project file
        is stored as an XML file with the name <mark>nwProject.nwx</mark>. This file contains all
        the meta data unique for the project. That includes project settings.</p>
    <p>If this file is lost or corrupted, the structure of the project is lost. It is important to
        keep this file backed up.</p>
    <p>The project XML file is suitable for diff tools and version control, although a timesetamp is
        set in the meta section on line 2 each time the file is saved.</p>

    <h4>Project Documents</h4>
    <p>The project documents are saved in folders staring with <mark>data_</mark>. Each document has
        a file handle taken from the first 13 characters of a SHA256 hash of the system time. the
        documents are saved with a folder and filename derived from this hash.</p>
    <p>The reason for this is to avoid issues with file naming conventions and restrictions. The
        file name set in the tree view is only saved in the project XML file.</p>
    <p>Each document file contains a plain text version of the text from the editor. The file can in
        principle be edited in any text editor, and is suitable for diffing and version control if
        so desired.</p>
