<p>A brief guide to make the most out of the Build Project tool.</p>

<h2>Novel Title Formats</h2>
<p>The format of the various title levels in the files under the Novel folder can be customised in
    these settings. The actual title given in the headings of your files will replace all
    occurrences of the keyword <mark>%title%</mark>. Any static text will be left as-is in the
    final title. An empty field means the title isn't written out at all.</p>
<p>The available formatting keywords are:</p>
<p><mark>%title%</mark> &ndash; This is replaced with the text you put in your headings in your 
    documents</p>
<p><mark>%num%</mark> &ndash; This is replaced with the chapter number of your chapter type
    headings. These are generated automaticall starting from 1.</p>
<p><mark>%numword%</mark> &ndash; This is replaced with the chapter number of your chapter type
    headings, but instead of an arabic number, the word for it is used instead, e.g. One, Two,
    Fifteen, Twenty-Five, etc.</p>
<p><mark>\\</mark> &ndash; Two backslashes are replaced by a line break.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> The Scene format is treated slightly differently than the other title formats. If a
    scene format is a constant text, that is, contains no <mark>%title%</mark>, it will be treated
    as a scene separator instead. Scene separators are centred, and not shown if the chapter starts
    directly on the first scene. If the field is blank, a large space between the scenes is added
    instead.</p>

<h2>Build Overrides</h2>
<p><b>Novel Outline Mode:</b> This option will build an outline version of the novel rather than the
    full thing. It overrides the title format settings without changing them. Each title will be
    written out, and the synopsis text will appear instead of the body text of the files. Some of
    the other options are still available in Outline Mode.</p>

<h2>Include Non-Text Elements</h2>
<p><b>Include Synopsis:</b> This will add the synopsis comment as the first paragraph after each
    heading.</p>
<p><b>Include Comments:</b> This will include any comments as additional paragraphs in the text.</p>
<p><b>Include Keywords:</b> This will include any keywords and tags as clickable links after each
    heading.</p>

<h2>Additional Options</h2>
<p><b>Include Novel Files:</b> This means all files that don't have a layout of type "Note" will be
    included. This is the normal mode when exporting the novel itself without the notes.</p>
<p><b>Include Note Files:</b> This means all files with a layout of type "Note" <i>will</i> be
    included. Titles in note files are always left as they appear.</p>
<p><b>Ignore Export Flag:</b> Each file in the project tree has an "Include when building project"
    option set, which is indicated by a little check mark in the "Flags" column. Files without This
    tick will normally be skipped during build, but can be included if this option is enabled.</p>
