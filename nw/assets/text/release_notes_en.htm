<h2>Release 1.0 RC1</h2>
<p>This is the first release candidate for the upcoming release of novelWriter 1.0.</p>
<p>Since the fifth beta release about four weeks ago, not much has been changed in novelWriter. A
few minor tweaks have been made to the GUI. A number of features and tools are now automatically
switched off when there is no project or document open for those features to act upon. No serious
bugs have been reported or encountered, and I feel itâ€™s time to move on to the release candidates.
Most of the minor changes should not be noticeable to most users. However, there are a couple of
noticeable changes.</p>
<h3>Typewriter Mode</h3>
<p>"Typewriter Mode" of the editor has been improved. Essentially, this feature is a sort of smart
scroll. It tries to keep the cursor stationary in the vertical direction, and will try to scroll
the document up when the cursor skips to a new line while typing (or down in case of backspace).
This is similar to the way a typewriter scrolls the paper when hitting the return key. It improves
the writing experience as the current active line will stay at the same eye height level on the
screen.</p>
<p>Previously, the feature would lock the cursor to a given vertical position defined by the user.
Now, instead, the cursor will remain stationary in the vertical direction at any position the user
sets it to by mouse click or keyboard navigation. The user can define a minimum distance from the
top where this feature is activated. It makes it more flexible. The feature can be controlled from
the main Preferences.</p>
<h3>Switching Syntax Theme</h3>
<p>It is now possible to switch syntax highlighting theme without restarting novelWriter.
Previously, changing the theme would only half-way update the document, header and footer
background and text colour. The new settings would not be applied until the application was shut
down and started again. This makes it a bit tedious to look through themes to find the one you
want. This issue has now been resolved.</p>
<p>Switching main GUI theme still requires a restart.</p>
